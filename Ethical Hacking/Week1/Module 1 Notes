## 1.1 – Understanding Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing
### 1.1.1 – Overview
**[[Dictionary#Ethical Hacker|Ethical Hacker]]** describes a person who acts as an attacker and evaluates the security posture of a computer network for the purpose of minimizing risk
- Exclusion of the work “Ethical”, the NIST Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) defines a **[[Dictionary#Hacker|Hacker]]** as an “unauthorized user who attempts to or gains access to an information system”
- Ethical hackers report their findings to a company that they are hired by, while malicious hackers will 
### 1.1.2 – Why Do We Need to Do Penetration Testing?
Without penetration testing, there would be countless vulnerabilities exposed by malicious hackers, and the only action to be taken is post-attack, while hiring ethical hackers will allow you to prepare against bad actors
### 1.1.3 – Researching PenTesting Careers
In This Lab

- Analyze Penetration Test Job Requirements
- Discover Resources to Further Your Career
### 1.1.4 – Threat Actors
#### Different Types of Threat Actors
**Organized Crime**
- Several years ago, the cybercrime industry took over the number-one spot, previously held by the drug trade, for the most profitable illegal industry
	- consists of very well-funded and motivated groups that will typically use any and all of the latest attack techniques
**Hacktivists**
- not motivated by money
	- looking to make a point or further their beliefs using cybercrime as their method of attack
**State-Sponsored Attackers**
- Cyber war and espionage
	- governments will use cyber attacks to steal information from their opponents
**Insider Threats**
- an insider threat that comes from inside an organization
## 1.2 – Exploring Penetration Testing Methodologies
### 1.2.1 – Overview
nothin really
### 1.2.2 – Why Do We Need to Follow a Methodology for Penetration Testing?
Must be able to show that the methods planned for a pentest are reliable
- using known methods, you can provide documentation of the procedure that has been used by many people
### 1.2.3 – Environmental Considerations
Often combined for the overall scope of a pentest, but can be provided individually
**Network Infrastructure Tests**
- includes switches, routers, firewalls, and supporting resources, such as authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) servers and IPSs
**Application-Based Tests**
- testing for misconfigurations, input validation issues, injection issues, and logic flaws
**Penetration Testing in the Cloud**
- Azure, AWS, Google all have to take security extremely seriously
- security is dependent on the cloud model
	- Software as a Service (SaaS)
	- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
		- customer is responsible for data, applications, runtime, middleware, VMs, containers, and operating systems in VMs
**Unknown-Environment Test**
- tester is provided a very limited amount of information
	- tester starts out with the same information an external attacker might have
**Known-Environment Test**
- tester starts out with a significant amount of information about the organization and its infrastructure
	- network diagrams, IP addresses, configurations, and a set of user credentials
- goal is to allow the tester to find as many security holes as possible
**Partially Known Environment Test**
- hybrid between the former two tests
	- allows tester to provide results from the perspective of an external attacker
- good approach is a scope where the testers start on the inside of the network and have access to a client machine
### 1.2.5 – Surveying Different Standards and Methodologies
Many pentesting methodologies have been around for a while and continue to be updated as new threats emerge
**MITRE ATT&CK**
- great resource for learning about an adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
	- both offensive security professionals and incident responders and threat hunting teams use the MITRE ATT&CK framework today
- collection of different matrices of tactics, techniques, and subtechniques
**OWASP WSTG**
- OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) is a comprehensive guide focused on web application testing
	- covers high-level phases of web application security testing and digs deeper into the testing methods used
**NIST SP 800-115**
- Special Publication (SP) 800-115 provides organizations with guidelines on planning and conducting information security testing, superseding the previous standard document, SP 800-42
**OSSTMM**

### 1.2.6 – Lab: Compare Pentesting Methodologies
#### OSTMM
The Institute for Security and Open Methodologies (ISECOM) provides free publications to improve how security is tested, analyzed, and implemented
- OSSTMM is one of these, currently in version 3.02 – copyrighted in 2010

The primary purpose of ISECOM is to provide a scientific methodology for the accurate characterization of operational security through examination and correlation of test results in a consistent and reliable way
- essentially using the scientific method in order to make pentesting more documented

Six outcomes assured when the OSSTMM guidelines are correctly followed
1. the test was conducted thoroughly
2. the test included all necessary channels
3. the posture for the test complied with the law
4. the results are measurable in a quantifiable way
5. the results are consistent and repeatable
6. the results contain only facts derived from the tests themselves

Ten steps of applying the OSSTM when the 4 point process and trifecta are combined
1. Passively collect data of normal operations to comprehend the target
2. Actively test operations by agitating operations beyond the normal baseline
3. Analyze data received directly from the operations tested
4. Analyze indirect data from resources and operators
5. Correlate and reconcile intelligence from direct and indirect data test results to determine operational security processes
6. Determine and reconcile errors
7. Derive metrics from both normal and agitated operations
8. Correlate and reconcile intelligence between normal and control which would best be implemented
9. Map the optimal state of operations to processes
10. Create a gap analysis to determine what enhancements are needed for processes governing necessary protection and controls to achieve the optimal operational state from the current one
#### PTES

## 1.3 – Building Your Own Lab
### 1.3.1 – Overview
### 1.3.2 – Requirements and Guidelines for Penetration Testing Labs
| Requirement for Guideline         | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Closed Network                    | You need to ensure controlled access to and from the lab environment and restricted access to the internet                                                          |
| Virtualized computing environment | This allows for easy deployment and recovery of devices being tested                                                                                                |
| Realistic Environment             | If you are staging a testing environment, it should match the real environment as closely as poossible                                                              |
| Health Monitoring                 | When something crashes, you need to be able to determine why it happened                                                                                            |
| Sufficient hardware resources     | You need to be sure that a lack of resources is not the cause of false results                                                                                      |
| Multiple Operating Systems        | Many times you will want to test or validate a finding from another system. It is always good to test from different operating systems to see if the results differ |
| Duplicate tools                   | A great way to validate a finding is to run the same test witha  different tool to see if the results are the same                                                  |
| Practice targets                  | You need to practice using your tools. To do this, you need to practice on targets that are known to be vulnerable                                                  |
