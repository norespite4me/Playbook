### Lab 1 – (1.2.6)
- compare pentesting methodologies
	- researched OSSTMM, PTEST, OWASP WSTG, and MITRE ATT&CK
		- some of these we visited in the last class
- visited  [ISECOM](https://www.isecom.org) website and researched OSSTMM and how ISECOM develops it
	- six assumed outcomes
		1. the test was conducted throroughly
		2. the test included all necessary channels
		3. the posture for the test complied with the law
		4. the results are measurable in a quantifiable way
		5. the results are consistent and repeatable
		6. the results contain only facts as derived from the tests themselves
- Gathered information about PTES
	- seven main sections
		1. Pre-engagement Interactions
		2. Intelligence gathering
		3. Threat Modeling
		4. Vulnerability Analysis
		5. Exploitation
		6. Post Exploitation
		7. Reporting
	- purpose is to provide businesses and security service providers with a common language and scope for performing pentesting
- Gathered information about OWASP WSTG
	- five phases of Web Testing Security Framework
		1. Before development begins
		2. During definition and design
		3. During development
		4. During deployment
		5. During maintenance operations
	- 12 categories of active tests defined in the OWASP Web Testing Framework
		1. information gathering
		2. configuration and deployment management testing
		3. identity management testing
		4. authentication testing
		5. authorization testing
		6. session management testing
		7. input validation testing
		8. testing for error handling
		9. testing for weak cryptography
		10. business logic testing
		11. client-side testing
		12. API testing
- Gathered information about MITRE ATT&CK
	- developed to document common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks
	- six common cases for ATT&CK
		1. adversary emulation
		2. red teaming
		3. behavioral analytics development
		4. defensive gap assessment
		5. SOC maturity assessment
		6. cyber threat intelligence enrichment
	- Three ATT&CK domains
		1. enterprise
		2. mobile
		3. ICS
### Lab 2 – (1.3.6/7)
- investigated kali linux, ran a vm, and launched into the OS
	- navigated the panels and application menu
	- launched the terminal and ran some commands
		- man man
			- the system’s manual pager, displays manuals for different commands
		- navigated directories using terminal commands
