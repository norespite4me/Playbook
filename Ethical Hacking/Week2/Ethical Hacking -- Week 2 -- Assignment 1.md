# Labs
## Lab 3.3 – Using Recon Tools
- logged into kali shell to use nmap to scan ports and vulnerabilities and how to research CVEs using the *National Vulnerability Database*
- used gvm tool to do vulnerability scanning
	- similar to nmap, but has a GUI
## Lab 4.4 – Simulated Phishing Campaign
- used SET to create malicious packages (PDF with embedded EXE) that can be executed on target computers and clone websites to steal credentials
- used BeEF to mess with user (idle tab changing, fake notifications that link to malicious sites)
