**What is one tool or method you used during recon this week? How did it work?**
- SET
	- i like CLI tools, and it was pretty neat to clone a web page and steal the login credentials before redirecting the user back to the real site
**How can companies protect themselves from passive recon or OSINT gathering?**
- monitor certificate transparency logs so that bad actors will have a harder time gleaning info from certs
- ensure employee training exists to help prevent oversharing information on social media that may help bad actors find a juicy target
- audit public repos like github
	- no credentials in plaintext EW!
- send takedown requests for archived information stored in the wayback machine
**Which social engineering technique do you think is the most dangerous, and why?**
This is a tough one, because there are a lot up there for me. Iâ€™ll throw out the USB drop attack though because once someone plugs that thing in they are SCREWED! and humans are so curious by nature
**What ethical lines must ethical hackers be careful not to cross when using these methods?**
They need to ensure that everything stays confidential according to the agreement that they have made with the company. They must remain in the scope of the project, perform their attacks at the proper and confirmed times, and provide correspondence and well-formatted reports for those who hired them.
